This project was created along to a tutorial by MayanWolfe for learning purposes.
What I learned/practiced:
    1.) Writing out the fetch syntax and grabbing resources from an existing pokemon api.
    2.) Creating a constructor using the class syntax
    3.) Practicing OOP
        a.) Encapsulation by creating objects using the class constructor to hold selected  info about a pokemon grabbed from the api
        b.) Inheritance by extending the Poke constructor with the PokeInfo 
    4.) Practiced appending elements to the DOM
